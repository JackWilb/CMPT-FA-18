HW4 Reasoning

Our program, written in assembly, is better than the assembled c code in two ways: it has less instructions and uses less 
memory. Our code uses 9 functions and only 2 memory registers. The initial code used far more instructions and more memory 
registers. We didn't tally up the exact number for the given code but it's clearly far more. 

Additionally, our code runs much faster (on account of the fewer instructions and less memory use). We benchmarked each
function with bash and found that our code took far less time. Our code took 0.5 seconds whereas the supplied code took
around 1.5. This is a big speed up over the compiled C code.
